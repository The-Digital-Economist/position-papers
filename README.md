## Position Papers

### [The Antifragility Imperative: Risk Management Beyond the Triple Crisis](./The Antifragility Imperative Risk.pdf)
This paper explores how the converging crises of 2020—from global health emergencies to systemic unrest—revealed deep structural fragilities. It argues for a shift beyond conventional risk management toward *antifragility*: the ability to grow stronger through disruption. Through analysis of uneven global responses, the paper advocates for systemic preparedness and resilience in a volatile world.

### [The Gray Rhino in the Room: The Fragility of Digital Technologies](./The%20Gray%20Rhino%20in%20the%20Room.pdf)
This paper frames digital technologies as “gray rhinos”—highly probable but neglected threats—and investigates how rising instability exposes their systemic vulnerabilities. It calls for urgent action to strengthen digital resilience as a core pillar of future-ready infrastructure.

### [Optionality: The Missing Piece in Building Antifragility](./Optionality.pdf)
This paper emphasizes *optionality*—the capacity to pivot and adapt—as a key but often overlooked component of antifragile systems. In a world where shocks cascade through global networks, optionality becomes essential for thriving amid uncertainty.

### [What the Future Looks Like](./What%20the%20Future%20Looks%20Like.pdf)
Instead of making predictions, this paper offers a framework for navigating future uncertainty. Drawing on thinkers like Popper and Taleb, it explores key global tensions and trajectories and encourages scenario-based thinking to prepare for multiple potential futures.

###  [Investing in the Post-COVID World](./Investing%20in%20the%20Post-COVID%20World.pdf)
Amid the “Age of Disorder,” this paper examines how investors can adapt to macroeconomic shifts—from digital acceleration to climate risk. It offers impact-focused strategies for investing in a volatile and rapidly evolving global economy.

###  [The Shock After the Shock: How the Pandemic is Shaping the Human-Centered Digital Economy](./The%20Shock%20After%20the%20Shock.pdf)
This paper examines how COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation while exposing systemic weaknesses. It explores the dual nature of the crisis—biological and digital—and outlines design principles for building an inclusive and antifragile digital economy.
